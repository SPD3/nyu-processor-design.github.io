# Git and GitKraken

---

## Purpose

`GitKraken` is a graphical user interface tool for tracking git repos. It 
provides graphs and visual representations of branches to make it easier to 
track who is working on what when. Also, the application provides easy to user 
interfaces to perform all the major local git functions that you would add the 
command line (push, pull, branch, merge, etc). GitKraken is an **optional** 
tool within this team but it may make understanding git easier. This tutorial 
will provide a brief introduction to GitKraken but if you would like more
